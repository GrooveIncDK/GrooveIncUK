                        collect it, and what we do with it. When you share information with us, we can make our services
                        even better for you. For instance, we can show you more relevant search results and ads, help
                        you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our

                    <dd>Our customers have the right to access, correct and delete personal data relating to them, and
                        to object to the processing of such data, by addressing a written request, at any time. The

                        by unauthorized third parties. However, the Company does not control each and every risk related
                        to the use of the Internet, and therefore warns the Site users of the potential risks involved
                        in the functioning and use of the Internet.

                    <dd>You can view or edit your personal data online for many of our services. You can also make
                        choices about our collection and use of your data. How you can access or control your personal
                        data will depend on which services you use. You can choose whether you wish to receive
                        promotional communications from our web site by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. If you
                        receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by
                        following the directions in that message. You can also make choices about the receipt of

                    <dd>Our store collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our
                        services. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you create a personal account.
                        We get some of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example, using
                        technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on
                        your device. We also obtain data from third parties (including other companies). For example, we
                        supplement the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other companies. We also use
                        services from other companies to help us determine a location based on your IP address in order
                        to customize certain services to your location. The data we collect depends on the services
                        and features you use.
